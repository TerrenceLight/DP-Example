Demonstration of basic dynamic programming capabilities.

Problem description: You are given an array of numerical values. You want to find the maximum sum of numbers possible from this array.
However, you cannot add the numerical value of two adjacent array slots to your total

E.G.
1 2 4 9 3
If you choose to add 2 to your numerical total, you cannot add both 1 and 2.
The largest numerical total of this group is 10: 1 + 9
An incorrect path you can take would be 1 + 4 + 3 = 8
